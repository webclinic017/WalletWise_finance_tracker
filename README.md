# WalletWise_finance_tracker
This project is a financial tracking program that enables users to track their expenses (based on categories eg food, rent, shopping, transportation, healthcare services) and their income streams and accounts (either mobile money(Momo), cash on hand, or bank). The program allows users to select the day the transaction took place through an interactive calendar interface, and based on the date of translation, the program stores the categories of items that they spent on, the amount of money they spent per category of expenditure, and the account from which the money was withdrawn in an excel sheet, that is unique to the user. The program also allows users to transfer money between their accounts, e.g. in a situation where a user withdraws money from their bank account,  and has it in the form of cash. Users can view their total expenditures per category, per day, or even the overall total expenses. 
NB: The program runs from Login_project file
